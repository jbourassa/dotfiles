# Yet another dotfiles repo
I'm not particularly pround of my current dotfiles setup but I wanted to make sure I don't loose anythong on accident so here here it is : yet anoter dotfiles repo!

Feel free to copy whatver you may like.

## Credits
I did not write much of this myself, but I forgot where I got it all. I can't take credit for this stuff.

Oh and the setup file is from [holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). I totally stole that one.
